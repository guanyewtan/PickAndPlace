# PickAndPlace
This repo is a WIP by Tan Guan Yew for NUS ATAP AY20/21 S2, cloned from https://github.com/TechmanRobotInc/tmr_ros1[TM_ROBOT] github and undergoing development. ROS1 is currently used, and contains scripts that allow control over the Techman TM Robotic Arm (e.g. to pick up an item and place it down at a desired location)
